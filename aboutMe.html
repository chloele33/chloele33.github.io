			<h1> About Me</h1>
			<div id = "introductionP">
			<p> Hello, I am a senior undergraduate student enrolled in the Digital Media Design program 
				at the University of Pennsylvania. I am currently pursuing a BSE degree
				from Penn's School of Engineering and Applied Science. At the same time, I am also pursuing a MSE degree in Computer Graphics and Game Technology at Penn. 
			</p>
			<p> Growing up, I have always loved art and design. Along the way, I also became interested in computer science. At the intersection of artistic and technical skills, I found myself both a designer and a developer. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In the future, I see myself pursuing a career in software development, computer graphics, or UX/UI design.
