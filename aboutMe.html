			<h1> About Me</h1>
			<div id = "introductionP">
			<p> Hello, I am a recent graduate of the University of Pennsylvania's School of Engineering and Applied Science. I majored in Digital Media Design(Computer Science + Computer Graphics) and minored in Data Science. Currently, I am pursuing an MSE degree in Computer Graphics and Game Technology at Penn. 
			</p>
			<p> Growing up, I have always loved art and design. Along the way, I also became interested in computer science. At the intersection of artistic and technical skills, I find myself to be both a designer and a developer. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In the future, I see myself pursuing a career in software development, computer graphics, or UX/UI design.
